A fibonacci heap is a data structure best used for applications such as priority queues.
What they allow is for is `get_minimum`, `pop_minimum`, and `alter_key` to run in constant time.
Likewise, `get_minimum` will run in logarithmic time (amortized).
For further explanations as to what this means, please watch [the video this project was based upon](https://youtu.be/6JxvKfSV9Ns).

## Requirements
* C++20 (`concepts` & `compare`)
* CMake 3.24 or greater
* CTest

## Usage
This project is designed with Modern CMake principals in mind, so it can easily be used with other CMake projects.
Either install or otherwise link the project, and add:

```cmake
find_package(FibonacciHeap 1.0.0 REQUIRED)
# Add Targets
target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE GRon::FibonacciHeap)
```

## API
The API for the Fibonacci Heap is quite simple:

* `FibonacciHeap<std::three_way_comparable T, class Container = std::vector>`
  * Creates a Fibonacci Heap object with the provided key type T.
  T **must** be `three_way_comparable`, hence the notation above.

  * `Node`
    * The format the data in the heap is stored in.
    * `T key`
      * Key held by the node
    * `Node* parent`
      * The parent node
    * `std::vector<Node*> children`
      * The child nodes
  * `void insert(T key)`
    * Emplaces a key at the back of the `root_list` vector

  * `Node* get_minimum()`
    * Returns a pointer to the node with the lowest key
    * Also cleans up the heap, allowing `insert()`, `pop_minimum()`, and `alter_key()` to run in constant time.
      Should be called relatively frequently for best results, but the first call after using the other functions may be slower.
      However, once the heap is ordered, this runs in constant time as well.

  * `Node pop_minimum()`
    * Pops off the _minimum node and returns the entire node
    * Makes a call to `get_minimum`, so the same distinctions apply

  * `void alter_key(T key, T new_key)`
    * Updates the node containing `key` to now hold `new_key`
    * Can be combined with `pop_minimum` to remove keys from the heap

## Building
1. Clone the source code

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Macr0Nerd/FibonacciHeap.git
    ```

2. Change directory into the project and create an output directory

    ```bash
    cd FibonacciHeap/
    mkdir build
    ```

3. Generate Makefiles *(if using Ninja, add `-GNinja`)*

    ```bash
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -H. -Bbuild
    ```

4. Build project

    ```bash
    cmake --build build/ --config RELEASE
    ```
   
5. Install the project. Examples for Ninja and Make have been provided

    ```bash
    cd build
    make install
    ninja install
    ```

6. (Optional) Run tests

    ```bash
    cd build
    ctest -C RELEASE
    ```
